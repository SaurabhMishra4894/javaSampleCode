Car Purchase Utility 

Problem Statement : 
* This application is controlled by the admin who will manage customers along with their purchased cars. 
* Customer will have an ID, name, and list of purchased Cars 
* Car will have an ID, model (Eg: I20 for Hyundai), price, resale value. 
* Cars can be of three types ONLY - Toyota, Maruti, Hyundai. 
* Resale values for different types of car will be different i.e 80% X price,60% X price, 40% X price resp. 

Admin can : 
* Add new Customer, 
* Add new Car to an existing Customer, 
* List all Customers with their cars sorted by name, 
* List individual Customer based on ID, 
* Generate prizes for the customer(Explained Below). 

Prizes : 
Your application will generate 6 random but existing IDs of customers. Admin will enter 3 IDs. 
The IDs matching with the randomly generate IDs, will get a prize. For example : 
Lets say will have customers with following IDs - 2,5,1,7,8,9,10,12,15,13 
Your system picks 6 IDs randomly say - 8,9,15,13,5,2 
Admins enters 3 IDs 20,16,9 
So only the customer with ID 9 will be eligible for the prize. 

Important Points : 
* Do research about discussed topics before you start implementing this application. 
* Follow proper coding conventions as discussed. 
* Do not use arrays at all. Use collections instead. 
* Be stringent on time Complexity.
